2. It uses the data set train_data_big.csv
3. File path will have to be changed according to your directory.

4. Open Text_Classification 2.R for kNN
5. It uses the data set train_data_small.csv
6. File path will have to be changed according to your directory.

7. Open Text_Classification 4.R for ensemble
8. It uses the data set train_data_big.csv
